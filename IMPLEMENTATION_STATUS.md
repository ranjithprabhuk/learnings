## 🎯 How to Use This Repository

### For Immediate Start (Day 1)

1. **Read These Files First**:
   - README.md (main overview)
   - docs/getting-started.md (setup guide)
   - phase-1-fundamentals/README.md (start here)

2. **Set Up Environment**:
   - Install Node.js, Git, VS Code
   - Copy .env.example to .env and add API keys
   - Navigate to project-1-linear-regression and run `npm install`

3. **Start Learning**:
   - Watch 3Blue1Brown Linear Algebra videos
   - Begin implementing Project 1
   - Update PROGRESS.md weekly

### As You Progress

Create the remaining files as needed:
- **Before each phase**: Create the phase README with theory and objectives
- **Before each project**: Create project README and package.json
- **During development**: Implement, document, deploy
- **After completion**: Update PROGRESS.md, write reflection, share on social media

---

## 📝 Notes

### Design Philosophy

This learning plan is intentionally:
- **Practical**: Every theory concept has a project
- **Incremental**: Build complexity gradually
- **Complete**: Cover fundamentals → advanced → career
- **Flexible**: Can skip/customize phases based on interest

### Customization

Feel free to:
- Skip Phase 6 (Computer Vision) if focusing on LLMs
- Extend time on phases that interest you
- Use different datasets for projects
- Choose different tech stack (React vs Svelte, etc.)
- Add your own projects

### Open Questions

Decide as you progress:
- Which LLM provider to focus on (OpenAI vs Anthropic)
- Which vector database to use (Pinecone vs Chroma)
- Which framework for Phase 7 production app (Next.js vs other)
- Whether to do Advanced Phase in Python or skip it

---

## 🚀 Quick Start Commands

```bash
# Start Phase 1, Project 1
cd phase-1-fundamentals/project-1-linear-regression
npm install
npm run dev

# Update progress
vim PROGRESS.md

# Create weekly reflection
mkdir -p docs/weekly-reflections
touch docs/weekly-reflections/week-1.md

# Deploy a project (example with Vercel)
cd project-directory
vercel deploy
```
